## Automation Testing

- must be good in one programming language ( String manipulation, arrays, oop, stack, queue, hash mapping ) 
### Selenium Webdriver using TestNG Framework
What is automation testing ?
when we do automation testing ?
Why we need automation testing ?
What is test automation framwork ?
- A testing framwork is a set fo guidlines or rules used for creating and designing test cases.
- A framwork is comprised of a combination of practices and tools that are designed to help QA professiaonls test more effiently.
#### Types of Framwork ?
1. Linear Automation framework: Record-and-playback, the tester records each step such as navigation, user input, or checkpoints, and then plays the script back automatically to conduct the test.  Selenium IDE is the example.
2. Module Bases Testing Framework: Based on POM, The framwework divides the entire "Application Under Test" into a number of logical and isolated modules.
3. Data Driven Testing Framework: file Readers, Data-Driven is a test automation framework which stores test data in a  table or spreadsheet format.
4. Hybrid framework is the combination of two or more frameworks. 

#### Selenium Suits
1. Selenium IDE: it is record and playback tool, which only supports only firefox. it does not allow conditional statements.
2. Selenium RC Server ( selenium remote control server): Selenium RC sends test to a server through which execution is performed.it does not interact with the browser directly due to which the execution of test is very slow.
3. Selenium WebDriver: it interacts directly with the browser while executing the test. Execution is faster compare to RC.
4. Selenium Grid: similar architecture as the selenium RS and it used to execute parallel test on multiple environments

#### Selenium WebDriver
- it allows you to execute cross-browser tests. 
- it interacts with the broswer directly therefore test execution is fast. 
- WebDriver Interface is the core of the Selenium WebDriver as it has all the required methods and respective nested interfaces defined within it, which helps in simulating user actions inside the browser.


**Maven :** Maven is a build automation tool that is used to manage the project dependency and the whole projec life cycle.
**Pom.xml :"** pom.xml contains projct information and configuration details used by the Maven build
**dependencies :** Any library on which a java project is depend on, to run or build is called a dependency. Example: Selenium Jars

#### Most Common functions:
Find Element : `WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.linkText("read more"));`
Click: `element.click();` (this method clicks on the selected element.)  
GetText: `String txt = element.getText();` (this method retrieves the text of the selected element as a String.)  
Send Keys:`element.sendKeys("text");` (this method sends a sequence of characters or a string to the selected element.)  
Navigate To: `driver.navigate().to("url");` (this method loads a new web page in the existing browser window.)  
Navigate Forward: `driver.navigate().forward();` (this method enables the web browser to click on the forward button in the existing browser window.)  
Navigate Back: `driver.navigate().back();` (this method enables the web browser to click on the back button in the existing browser window.)  
Navigate Refresh:`driver.navigate().refresh();` (this method refreshes the currently open page.)  
Get: `driver.get("url");` (this method loads a new web page in the existing browser window.)  
Get Title:`driver.getTitle();` (this method fetches the title of the current webpage and returns it as a String.)  
Get Current URL:`driver.getCurrentUrl();` (this method fetches the current URL of the web page and returns it as a String.)  
Quit: `driver.quit();` (this method terminates all windows operated by the WebDriver.)  


##### Locators 


#### Page Objet Model:
- Page Object Model (POM) is a desing pattern, that creates Object Repository for Web UI element.
- In Page Object model (POM) all Web Elements and the method that operate on these Web Elements are maintained inside a separate file and page class. A task like verification or assertion  should be separate as part of Test methods in a test class.
- Due to this structure, we create functions bases on logical tasks that we may need to perform multiple types and use these functionals in different tests.
- for example, we can create a function for login and use in a happy case with a login successful assertion and in  a negative case with a login failed assertion.
- Using Page Object Model reduces redundancy in code and it also make test case maintenance very easy.


#### Data Driven Framework
- In data-driven, we separate test inputs in a seprate file and use a fiel reader to get
- the data form that file into our scripts. this provide us with separate repository for data input or outputs. 

#### TestNG
- TestNG is an automation testing framework in which NG stands for "Next Generation" which uses the annotation(@)
- Using TestNG, you can generate a proper report and you cna easily come to know how many test caes are passed, failed and skipped.
- if Follows ATDD approach which stands for Acceptance Test Driven Development Approach.
- it involves writing automated tests from the users perspective and is designed to assert and validate the functionality of the software being developed.

#### @Test Annotation
- @Test is used to tell that the method under it is a test case.
- Since we use annotations in TestNG, we needed to import the packages org.testing.annotation.*
- You may have multiple test cases( therefore, multiple @Test annotations) in a single TestNG file.

#### common attributes
- description: It is the description for the methods 
- Eg: @Test(description = "test method")
- Priority: This command sets the priority of the test methods.
- Eg: @Test(priority  1)

#### Assertions
1. assertEquals
Assert.assertEquals(actual, expected);
Validates if the actual and expected values are the same or not.
2. assertNotEquals
Assert.assertNotEquals(actual,expected,Message);
whenever the expected and actual values match, the assertion fails with an exception and marks the testcase as "failed".
3. assertTrue
Assert.assertTure(condion);
This method asserts if the condition s true or not. if not, then the exception error is thrown.
4. assertNotNull
Assert.assertNotNull(object);
Verifies that value returned by object is not null. it will be pass if returned.

#### XML runner
- XML runner allows user s to call  locators and different test class
- using the XML runner, the automated test cases are executed
- the report gets generated basesd on the results of the XML runner.
- 
#### Runner.xml
`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`
`<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "http://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd">`
`<suite name="SmokeSuite">`
    `<test name="LoginclassTestCase">`
        `<classes>`
            `<class name="MyTestProject.Test.LoginTest"/>`
         `</classes>`
    `</test>`
`</suite>`
##### Steps to run runner.xml
1. Go to Edit Configuration
2. Click on the add (+) to add new configuration
3. Click on testNG
4. Give name "Runner"
5. select the "Suite" from the Test Kind dropdown.
6. Select the file in the suite input field.
7. Then click on apply and ok.

#### TestNG Reporting
- Once we execute test cases using TestNG, it will generate a default HTML report
- Execute the testing.xml file and refresh the project.
- Navigate to 'test-output' folder. Now you should find a report "examlable-report.html". this is the default report generated by TestNg.

##### Steps
1. open the edit configuration of Runner that you have created.
2. go to listeners
3. click on the use reporters
3. click apply and ok.


#### Common Questions
Why do we need RemoteWebDriver class?
What does Browser Drivers do?
When a test script is executed with the help of WebDriver, the following tasks are performed in the background: Why do we use Chromium Driver Class?
What are important methods defined in WebDriver?
